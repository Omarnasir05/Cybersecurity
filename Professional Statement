I am an Information Systems major at the University of Texas at Arlington with a strong foundation in programming, data management, and systems analysis. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, 
I have developed proficiency in Python, Java, C++, SQL, and web development technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experience as a programming tutor has strengthened my communication and leadership 
skills, allowing me to explain complex technical concepts clearly and effectively. I have led and contributed to multiple projects involving database design, backend development with Java Spring Boot, and data-driven
application development. Whether optimizing workflows or building user-friendly systems, I approach challenges with analytical precision and a focus on collaboration. With a growing interest in cybersecurity and 
data analysis, I aim to leverage my technical and problem-solving skills to drive innovative and efficient IT solutions in dynamic professional environments.
